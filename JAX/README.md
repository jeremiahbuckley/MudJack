How to Run the Program
Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn jax jaxlib==0.4.8
Note that you may need to use the appropriate wheel for jaxlib depending on your hardware and whether you want GPU support. For CPU-only usage, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install jax jaxlib==0.4.8 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
Save the Script

Save the provided script in a file named main.py.

Run the FastAPI Server

Start the server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will start and listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Test the API Endpoint

You can test the /test endpoint by navigating to http://localhost:8000/test in your web browser or using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8000/test
Example JSON Response
json
Copy code
{
  "jax.named_call": {
    "error": null,
    "average_time": 0.0001234567
  },
  "jax.numpy.array": {
    "error": null,
    "average_time": 0.0012345678
  },
  ...
}
error: Contains the error traceback if the function fails to execute; otherwise, it is null.
average_time: The average execution time in seconds over 10 runs.
Important Considerations
JAX Version: Ensure that JAX version 0.4.8 is installed to match the testing requirements.
Hardware Variability: Execution times may vary based on the hardware where the tests are run. This script is designed to capture these variations.
GPU Support: If you are testing on GPU-enabled hardware, ensure that the appropriate CUDA version of jaxlib is installed.
Adjusting the Functions
You can add or modify the functions to test by editing the functions_to_test dictionary and providing corresponding test functions.

python
Copy code
functions_to_test = {
    'jax.new_function': test_new_function,
    # Add your custom test functions here
}
Potential Issues and Solutions
Error Handling: If a function raises an exception, the error traceback is captured and included in the response.
Randomness: The use of random inputs means that execution times may vary slightly between runs.
Complex Functions: Some functions like test_partial_eval() and test_trace_to_jax_pr_dynamic() are placeholders and need to be implemented based on specific use cases.
