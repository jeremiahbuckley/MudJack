How to Run the Program
Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn tensorflow==2.11.0
Save the Script

Save the provided script in a file named main.py.

Run the FastAPI Server

Start the server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will start and listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Test the API Endpoint

You can test the /test endpoint by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/test in your web browser or using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/test
Example JSON Response
json
Copy code
{
  "tf.linalg.svd": {
    "error": null,
    "average_time": 0.0001234567
  },
  "tf.math.reduce_logsumexp": {
    "error": null,
    "average_time": 0.0012345678
  },
  ...
}
error: Contains the error traceback if the function fails to execute; otherwise, it is null.
average_time: The average execution time in seconds over 10 runs.
Adjusting the Functions
You can add or modify the functions to test by editing the functions_to_test dictionary and providing corresponding test functions.

python
Copy code
functions_to_test = {
    'tf.new_function': test_new_function,
    # Add your custom test functions here
}
Important Considerations
TensorFlow Version: Ensure that TensorFlow version 2.11.0 is installed to match the testing requirements.
Deprecated Functions: Some functions, such as those under tf.compat.v1, might be deprecated. Ensure they are compatible with TensorFlow 2.11.0.
Hardware Variability: Execution times may vary based on the hardware where the tests are run. This script is designed to capture these variations.
